# Packet Sniffer Project

## Overview
This project is a simple packet sniffer built using Python and Scapy. It allows you to capture, analyze, and display network packets from a network interface. You can filter packets by type, and the sniffer allows for saving captured packets to a file for further analysis. This project provides insight into network traffic analysis, monitoring, and security.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy
  ```bash
  pip install scapy

## Features
- Capture network packets from a specified network interface.
- Analyze and display packet details including IP addresses, protocols, ports, etc.
- Filter packets by protocol (e.g., TCP, HTTP).
- Save captured packets to a file for later analysis.


## 1. Set up your environment
- Install necessary tools and libraries:
    - Wireshark or tcpdump: These are packet capture tools you can use to analyze network traffic.
    - Python (optional): You can use Python with libraries like scapy for custom packet sniffing scripts.
    - Scapy: A Python library that allows you to send, receive, and analyze network packets.

## 2. Understand the concepts of packet sniffing
- Packet Sniffer: Itâ€™s a tool that captures network traffic (packets) from a network interface, which can then be analyzed for various data like IP addresses, protocol types, ports, etc.
- Packet Structure: You will need to understand the basic structure of network packets, including headers like Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, etc.

## 3. Create a new GitHub repository
- Initialize a new repository for your project.
- Commit initial README to describe the project goals and tools used.

## 4. Implement Packet Sniffer using Python and Scapy
- Import the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    "from scapy.all import sniff"
- Write a function to capture packets:
    ```bash
    def packet_callback(packet):
      print(packet.show())  # This will print the packet's details

    - # Sniff packets from a specific interface (e.g., eth0 for Linux)
    - sniff(iface="eth0", prn=packet_callback, store=0)

- Explanation:
    - sniff(): The function used to capture packets.
    - iface: Specifies the network interface (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
    - prn: A callback function that processes each captured packet.
    - packet.show(): Displays packet details.

## 5. Filter packets based on certain criteria
- You may want to capture specific types of traffic, such as HTTP or TCP packets. You can use filters for this.
    ```bash
    sniff(filter="tcp port 80", prn=packet_callback, store=0)

## 6. Save captured data to a file
- You might want to save the captured packets to a file for further analysis:
    ```bash
    def packet_callback(packet):
      with open("packets.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(str(packet) + "\n")

## 7. Analyze captured packets
- Analyze the captured packets to extract useful information like source/destination IP, packet length, protocols, etc. This step can be enhanced by writing additional functions to parse the packet data:
    ```bash
    def analyze_packet(packet):
        if packet.haslayer(IP):
            print(f"Source IP: {packet[IP].src} -> Destination IP: {packet[IP].dst}")
        if packet.haslayer(TCP):
            print(f"TCP Packet: {packet[TCP].sport} -> {packet[TCP].dport}")
        
## 8. Enhance the Packet Sniffer
- Add additional functionality to capture specific types of packets like HTTP, DNS requests, etc.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) if you want a more sophisticated presentation of captured packets.

## 9. Test the project
- Test your packet sniffer on your local network or on a test network.
- Capture packets from different types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc.) and ensure that your packet sniffer is correctly filtering and displaying the relevant information.

## 10. Document the Project
- In the README file, document:
    - How to run the project.
    - Requirements (e.g., Python version, Scapy).
    - Explain the purpose of the project and how it works.

## 11. Commit and push to GitHub
- After completing the implementation, commit all the changes to your GitHub repository.
- Include code comments and detailed documentation for easy understanding of the project.

## 12. Share the Project
Include the GitHub link in your resume and showcase it as part of your portfolio. Consider adding a detailed explanation in your project description on GitHub.
